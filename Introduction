Hello everyone. 
Today I want to talk about my project. I used Burpsuit and sqlmap while creating this project. 
Burpsuit is a tool for testing and monitoring the security of web applications. 
This application allows monitoring of requests between client and server, thanks to manual proxy. 

Another tool I will use is sqlmap. Sqlmap is an open source infiltration tool that detects vulnerabilities of databases and steals information. 
It is often used by hackers. Sqlmap is generally used on Kali-Linux. My goal in the Burpsuit was to track the movements of the target page and set its parameters. 
I set up a manual proxy to watch the target site is working properly and started watching it on burpsuite. Then I learned the parameter of the target site. 
First I completed sqlmap installation in Kali terminal, then I installed sqlmap.py. I wrote some code to connect to the target site and pull the data through Sqlmap and connect to the targeted site.
Next, I chose the database and target table I want to infiltrate. I accessed the database on the target site and the table containing the login information. ,
Later, thanks to the information I obtained, I logged into the target site and completed my SQL injection project.
